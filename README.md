## Description
The Team Profile Generator is an application utilizing node.js and is run in the terminal. My motivation for this project was to have a team of developers to have their team members info close to them, rather than have to open Outlook, Slack, Discord, etc other apps to find their information. If the manager needed quick access to the engineer's Github profile, it will be easy to access this way. 

This homework taught me the importance of mixing JavaScript basics and advanced JavaScript. The application is far from completed or perfect, but I understood how to use inquirer packages and syntax apart of the package.

## Installation
The program needs the package "inquirer", installed through the following command:

"npm i inquirer --save"

and jest:
 
"npm i jest"

## Usage
Open the application in the terminal and type "node index.js". Follow the prompts and you will have your file containing all your team members.
